**Election-Audit Summary**

This script with some modifications can be used for any election. For an obvious example, simply changing the county names would allow this script to run for every county, in not just Colorado, but any county level election race or any state election race. 
This script could also be modified to include variables of time. Time would allow for tracking and trend analysis. For example, if this data was collected for these counties in 2021 an analysis could be done to track voter turnout in previous years and previous counties.
